for every loaded sprite check if correctly done (see check_img in so_long)

GNL on every line there can be spaces, but does not mean that its in the map
it can be a gap between 2 walls

11111111111
10000000001
11000000001
100    00001 <- space here, but still valid (just need to take care of this kind of case)
100000000011	(either you replace it by a 0 or by a 1)
100011100001
11111 111111  <- gap here but the map is still valid
